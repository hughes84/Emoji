# Design

I designed my memory card game with the aim to deliver a familiar, simple experience for the target user. The game itself is a classic popular game which I predict all users will know the rules on how to play. The game is simple and easy to play even if the user has not come across such a game before. The countdown timer gives the game an extra thrill as the clock ticks down. I'm sure this will excite the user. I used emoji images which are used by nearly everyone on a daily basis. I believe this will give the user some familiarity.

## Wireframes

I invisaged my game to be easy to use and allow the user to get playing quickly.
